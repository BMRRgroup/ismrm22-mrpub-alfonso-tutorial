# ALFONSO tutorial: modeling of lipid droplet size estimation based on restricted diffusion

This repository contains an [ALFONSO](https://github.com/BMRRgroup/alfonso "ALFONSO on github") tutorial on how to write custom model definition files.

Throughout this tutorial a Murday&Cotts-based lipid droplet size model will be developed and fitted to a multi-b-value multi-TM diffusion-weighted STEAM MRS dataset. 

To get started clone this repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/BMRRgroup/ismrm22-mrpub-alfonso-tutorial
cd ismrm22-mrpub-alfonso-tutorial
```
and open the interactive maltab live script tutorial [ALFONSO_Tutorial_LipidDropletSizeEstimation.mlx](./ALFONSO_Tutorial_LipidDropletSizeEstimation.mlx). 

For reference, also a static html version of the matlab live script is also given: [ALFONSO_Tutorial_LipidDropletSizeEstimation.html](./ALFONSO_Tutorial_LipidDropletSizeEstimation.html).

This repository accompanies [ISMRM 2022](https://www.ismrm.org/22m/)'s program #2776 *ALFONSO: A versatiLe Formulation fOr N-dimensional Signal mOdel fitting of MR spectroscopy data and its application in MRS of body lipids*.
